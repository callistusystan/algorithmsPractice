DP[len] = min # of operations to complete the string from position lenToId

------->len--------->

DP[len] = min {
  1 + DP[len+1]


}

giveaway of DP: is all the states previous to current independent
from future?


B

remember that using B and T,
  will cause freq[T] and freq[B] to be smaller

freq[T] = freq[T] - (freq[T] - 1)




C

if looking for minimum,
  think of :-
    1. DP
    2. Binary search
