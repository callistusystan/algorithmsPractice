# Algorithms and Data Structure Practice

After my recent technical interview at Google, I have decided to further increase my knowledge on algorithms and data structures to improve and quicken my ability to solve problems efficiently.

The book I am currently following is "Competitive Programming 3", by Stephen Halim.

I aim to complete as many coding challenges (suggested by the book) as I possibly can, which are available on the UVa online judge.

My solutions are kept in the UVa sub directory.
