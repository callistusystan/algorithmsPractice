# Algorithms and Data Structure Practice

After my recent technical interview at Google, I have decided to further increase my knowledge on algorithms and data structures to improve and quicken my ability to solve problems efficiently.

Initially, I was working with Python, but I have decided to switch to C++, to increase my awareness in memory management as well as checking for integer overflows.

The book I am currently following is "Competitive Programming 3", by Stephen Halim.

Currently, I aim to solve as many Codeforces problems as I can, from most solved to least solved.
